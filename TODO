TODO list


 - instead of webcam-dut.webm etc use primary.webm and secondary.webm
 then the mux pipeline doesnt ever need to be modified
 - Play button in column
 - disable create recording and export/delete buttons while encoding
 - labels for toolbar icons
 - audio is currently attached to one of the streams.. decouple this? but then you get a webcam video without any audio makes it difficult to use later - always attach to primary video source
 - Create a NewrecordingInfo class to store and return the properties of a new recording, this would be passed into webcamrecord or screencast record

 - Make ximagesrc capture just the primary monitor - might avoid crash when showing preview
 - Microphone levels
 - Input selection/pimary/secondary
 
  - two webcams
